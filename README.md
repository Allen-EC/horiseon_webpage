# Horiseon Webpage Refactor

## Description

I have been tasked by Horiseon to update their webpage in order to make it more accessible to users.

The code base is to follow accessibility standards.
The site is optimised for search engines.

Unfortunatly, I suffered a hardware failure before I could tackle this challange.
I was not able to get up and running again until the 28th November, when I re-started the pre-work so as to get this machine usable going forward.

I understand that this challange is incomplete, and I have run out of time.
I will however, return to this challange when I have a little more time for my own benifit, just so I know that I have completed it, even if it is not recorded as complete.
